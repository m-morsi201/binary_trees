This is my Project "0x1D. C - Binary trees".
At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explan the following without the help of Google:

	1. What is a binary tree
	2. What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
	3. What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
	4. What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
	5. What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
	6. What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree


All my files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
